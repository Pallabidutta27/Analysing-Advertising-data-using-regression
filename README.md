# Analysing-Advertising-data-using-regression
This project examines the impact of various advertising types on sales performance. It utilizes mathematical analysis to determine how much each advertising medium—such as TV commercials, Google ads, influencer marketing, social media posts, and billboards—contributes to sales increases. The objective is to identify the most effective advertising strategies, enabling businesses to allocate their budgets more wisely. 

The analysis is conducted using the R programming language, with results documented in R Markdown.
